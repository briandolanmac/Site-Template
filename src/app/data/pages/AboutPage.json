      "Green-House Renewables was founded in early 2006. The two owners, Vinny Novotny and Stephen O'Kane, were former employees of the company before having the opportunity to take over the business in 2013.",
      "After completing their first full renewable mechanical project — a residential development of 26 new-build houses in Lyndhurst on the Herbert Road — they decided to push forward with the Green-House strategy of always supplying and installing the highest quality renewable energy systems to their main contractor and architect customers, as well as branching out to homeowners who wanted to retrofit their property with the same systems.",
      "Vinny and Stephen have since grown the company to where it is today and continue to guide and direct the installation teams as well as the office staff who provide Green-House clients with bespoke heating and solar designs, SEAI grant details, and a wealth of knowledge and experience that has been built over the years."
