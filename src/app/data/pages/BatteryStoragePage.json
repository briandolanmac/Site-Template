      "Without battery storage, excess solar energy generated during the day is exported to the grid. A home battery stores this energy so you can use it in the evening and at night — when electricity costs are highest.",
      "As Certified Sigenergy Installers, we provide cutting-edge battery systems that integrate seamlessly with your solar panels. Sigenergy batteries are known for their reliability, efficiency, and sleek design.",
      "A typical home battery can store 5-15kWh of energy, enough to power your home through the evening and overnight. Combined with solar panels, you can achieve up to 90% energy independence."
