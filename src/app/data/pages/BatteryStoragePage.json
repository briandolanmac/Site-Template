        "paragraph": "The way the Solar panel + Battery pairing works is like this:  The solar panels generate electricity.  That electricity charges the battery.  The battery then supplies power to your home.   Why is this good?   If the panels generate enough power to fully charge the battery then you won't get an electric bill!  However, during the winter thy won't.  So the battery won't get fully charged by the panels.  BUT, you can top up the battery over night using cheaper electricity.  So even during very short and cloudy days you are still saving money by paying for cheaper electricity.   \n"

        "paragraph": "If you live in an area that is prone to storms and power cuts you won't lose power because the battery is providing the power to your home, not the grid.  We can't guarantee you won't lose power if the power cut lasts days but if your solar panels are generating power during the day and charging the batter you might be able to make it through the power cut."
