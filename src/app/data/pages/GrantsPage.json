      "The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) provides generous grants to homeowners who install solar PV systems. The grant covers a significant portion of your installation costs, making solar energy more affordable than ever.",
      "In addition to the SEAI grant, residential solar panel installations benefit from 0% VAT, further reducing the overall cost. Combined with energy savings of up to 70%, solar panels pay for themselves within a few years.",
      "As SEAI Registered installers, Green-House Renewables handles the entire grant application process on your behalf — so you can sit back and enjoy the savings."
