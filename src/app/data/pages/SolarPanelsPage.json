        "paragraph": "Let's start by explaining what it is and how it works.  Solar PV (photovoltaic) is a renewable technology that converts sunlight directly into electricity using semiconductor materials, typically silicon, in panels. \"Photo\" means light and \"voltaic\" means electricity. So the panels use the sun's light to make electricity that you can use to power your home.\n"

        "subHeading": "How much electricity does it create?",
        "paragraph": "The panels today are quite efficient.  Most houses in Ireland can fit enough panels on their roof to meet a majority of their needs.  One thing worth noting is that in the winter you won't generate as much but in the summer you will generate a lot.  Ireland has very long days in the summer.  Adding a battery will also significantly help you manage your electricity.  Check out the Battery section of this site for more information on that.\n"
