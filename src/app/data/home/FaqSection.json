      "question": "How does Solar PV work?",
      "answer": "Photovoltaic (PV) technology uses semiconductor cells to convert daylight (not just direct sunlight) into electricity. This electricity can power your home, reducing dependency on the grid. Excess energy can be stored in a battery, heat your hot water, or charge an EV."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much can I save?",
      "answer": "Savings depend on your system size and usage, but we aim for at least a 70% reduction in electricity bills. Many systems achieve a return on investment in 4-6 years, offering free electricity for decades after."
    },
    {
      "question": "What grants are available?",
      "answer": "The SEAI grant offers up to €1,800 for residential solar PV systems. There is also a grant of up to €300 for EV chargers. We guide you through the grant process and help you claim every euro available."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need planning permission?",
      "answer": "Generally, no. Planning laws changed so you don't need permission for rooftop solar panels unless you live in specific zones like air traffic control areas or protected structures."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is battery storage important?",
      "answer": "Yes, it helps you maximise your solar energy utilisation. Store excess energy generated during the day for use at night or during cloudy periods, reducing reliance on the grid and lowering your energy bills."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about maintenance?",
      "answer": "Solar panels are generally self-cleaning with rainwater. Our systems come with a lifetime workmanship guarantee, plus manufacturer warranties on panels and inverters for your total peace of mind."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does installation take?",
