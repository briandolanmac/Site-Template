      "question": "How do solar panels work in Ireland?",
      "answer": "Solar PV panels work through a process that converts sunlight directly into usable electricity. Each photovoltaic cell contains semiconductor material that creates an electric current when exposed to light. Modern solar cells work efficiently even in diffuse light conditions, making them ideal for Irish weather. The average Irish home can generate more than half its electricity needs through properly installed solar PV."

      "question": "How much will I save on my electricity bills?",
      "answer": "A Solar Path solar PV system can reduce your electricity bills by up to 70%, depending on your property's solar exposure and electricity demand. Solar panels typically last 25+ years, providing decades of reduced energy costs. Plus, you can sell excess electricity back to the national grid through the Microgeneration Support Scheme."

      "question": "What SEAI grants are available?",
      "answer": "The SEAI offers up to €1,800 for residential solar PV systems. For commercial installations, grants range from €2,400 up to €162,600. Solar Path handles the full grant application process, minimising hassle and maximising your grant potential."

      "question": "How much solar power does it take to run a house?",
      "answer": "The average Irish home requires a 3-4kWp solar PV system to generate significant electricity savings. This typically means installing 8-12 solar panels, depending on their individual power rating. A properly sized solar PV system can produce 2,500-3,500 kWh annually, supplying 50-70% of a typical household's electricity demand."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it worth getting solar panels in Ireland?",
      "answer": "Yes, solar panels are increasingly worthwhile investments in Ireland. Modern solar PV technology works efficiently even in Ireland's climate, and with rising electricity prices, solar power typically delivers a return on investment within 5-7 years. Government incentives through the solar PV grant and payments for excess electricity further enhance the financial benefits."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is battery storage and how does it work?",
      "answer": "Battery storage allows you to store excess electricity produced during daylight hours for use at night or during power price spikes. With a hybrid inverter, you stay in control of your own power, even when demand on the national grid is high. Modern lithium-ion battery systems integrate seamlessly with solar PV panels."

    {
      "question": "What warranty do you offer?",
      "answer": "We provide full warranty on all installations. Modern commercial solar panels have a typical lifespan of 25 to 30 years, with most reputable manufacturers providing 25-year or longer production warranties. We also offer comprehensive after-sales support."
