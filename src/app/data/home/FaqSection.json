      "question": "How do solar panels work in Ireland?",
      "answer": "Solar panels use photovoltaic cells to convert daylight (not just direct sunshine!) into electricity for your home. Any excess energy can be stored in a battery, used to heat water, charge your EV, or sold back to the grid. Ireland gets plenty of daylight to make solar worthwhile."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much will I save on my electricity bills?",
      "answer": "Most homeowners see a significant reduction in their electricity bills. Our systems are designed for long-term performance and can pay for themselves within a few years. After that, you're generating free electricity for decades."
    },
    {
      "question": "What SEAI grants are available?",
      "answer": "The SEAI offers up to €1,800 for residential solar PV systems. We'll guide you through the entire grant process and help you claim every cent — we handle all the paperwork so you don't have to."

    {
      "question": "What is an air-to-water heat pump?",
      "answer": "An air-to-water heat pump is a direct replacement for your existing gas or oil boiler. It runs on electricity and is tested at over 400% efficiency — meaning for every €1 you spend on electricity, you receive €4 worth of heat. It heats your radiators, underfloor heating, and provides hot water 24/7."
    },
    {
