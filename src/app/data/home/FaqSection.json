      "question": "So how does solar actually work?",
      "answer": "In a nutshell, solar panels use clever cells to turn daylight (not just sunshine!) into electricity for your home. Any extra energy? Store it in a battery, heat your water, or charge your EV. Pretty neat, right?"
    },
    {
      "question": "How much will I actually save?",
      "answer": "It depends on your setup, but we aim for at least a 70% drop in your electricity bills. Most systems pay for themselves in 4-6 years, and after that you're looking at free electricity for decades."
    },
    {
      "question": "What grants can I get?",
      "answer": "The SEAI offers up to €1,800 for residential solar PV systems and up to €300 for EV chargers. Don't worry about the paperwork — we'll walk you through the whole thing and make sure you claim every cent."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need planning permission?",
      "answer": "Nope, not usually! The rules changed so most homes can get rooftop solar without any planning hassle. There are a few exceptions (like if you live near an airport or in a protected building), but we'll let you know."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is battery storage worth it?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Think of it like a piggy bank for energy. Store up the power you generate during the day and use it at night or on cloudy days. It means less reliance on the grid and more savings in your pocket."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about maintenance?",
      "answer": "Barely any! Irish rain does most of the cleaning for you (finally, a perk of the weather!). Our systems come with a lifetime workmanship guarantee plus manufacturer warranties, so you're totally covered."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does installation take?",
      "answer": "Most home installations are done in just 1-2 days. Our team shows up on time, keeps everything spotless, and gets you up and running before you know it."
    },
    {
      "question": "What areas do you cover?",
      "answer": "We're based in Dublin but cover Wicklow, Kildare, Meath, and beyond. Give us a shout wherever you are — we'll sort you out!"
